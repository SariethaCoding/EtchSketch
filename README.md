# EtchSketch

Project objective : 
Create a type of Etch a Sketch where drawing over blocks with your mouse will colour them in

* Update - colourpicker
Learned how easy it is to implement a colour picker on the page!
New colour picker is now added and users can draw with any colour they desire now

* Update - Slider
Replaced the old way of creating a grid by inputing the number of squares in an input box with the brand new slider. Huzzah.

* Update - Pen toggle
Figured out how to toggle the pen on/off so you can click to start continous drawing and click again to stop. 
Also added indication on the side panel to show when the pen is toggled for drawing or not



* TO DO
- Add a 'help' pop up info block to explain the details
